This is a top-down 2D arcade game I'm using to mess around with Unity.

### Animated Tile

The [2d-extras repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-extras) from Unity contains something called an animated tile. This allows tiling with animation, which is pretty handy. However, the animation is extremely simple. It just cycles through sprites at a rate determined by the tilemap. For more advanced animation, it's probably best to use a prefab and forego tiling.
